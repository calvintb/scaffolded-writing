1. What were the benefits of using a context free grammar for your task domain?

    I think it helped with grading. It obviously made it much easier to determine if there was a valid response. 
    But it also helped with an important aspect of my task domain: establishing goals. I think a lot of people 
    don't play blackjack with goals, but because of this format, it would help the learner think more about what they want to do.

2. What were the down sides or difficulties of using a context free grammar for your task domain?

    It was very restrictive in their choices of goals. In a typical game of blackjack, you could pick almost any number as a goal,
    but in this scenario, it was too difficult to have a lot of options. It also was difficult to actually simulate all of the decisions that
    belong to the task domain because you usually have to reassess your goals when you receive new information.

3. What were the benefits of using a constraint based grading for your task domain?

    It worked out really well, because there aren't any perfect answers. There's a pool of correct actions to take so it worked 
    well to draw the lines of a couple of poor decisions and then let the learner decide what they want to try. It works well 
    because blackjack is very based on luck and future draws that there are a lot of correct possibilities.

4. What were the down sides or difficulties of using a constraint based grading for your task domain?

    It was hard to draw firm lines because anything could happen in that game. For example, I marked `standing at 5` as 
    a bad action, but that could win you some rounds. It was difficult to truly identify good and bad actions.
